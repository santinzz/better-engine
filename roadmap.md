Rust Chess Engine Development Roadmap
This roadmap outlines a structured approach to building your chess engine in Rust, following the design principles discussed. Each step builds upon the previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before moving to more complex features.

Phase 0: Folder Structure
A well-organized folder structure helps manage complexity as your project grows. Here's a suggested layout for your my_chess_engine project:

my_chess_engine/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs                 # Main entry point, handles UCI loop
│   ├── board.rs                # Defines Board struct, Color, Piece enums, board manipulation (make/unmake move)
│   ├── moves.rs                # Defines Move struct, move generation logic (pseudo-legal, legality checks)
│   ├── engine.rs               # Defines Engine struct, search algorithm (minimax, alpha-beta, iterative deepening, quiescence)
│   ├── evaluation.rs           # Contains the evaluation function and related data (PSTs)
│   ├── tt.rs                   # Transposition Table implementation (Zobrist hashing, TT struct)
│   ├── constants.rs            # Global constants (bitboard masks, precomputed attack tables, Zobrist keys)
│   └── lib.rs                  # (Optional) If you want to expose parts of your engine as a library
├── tests/                      # Integration tests for major components
│   ├── board_tests.rs
│   ├── movegen_tests.rs
│   └── search_tests.rs
├── benches/                    # Benchmarks using `criterion` or `iai`
│   ├── board_benches.rs
│   ├── movegen_benches.rs
│   └── search_benches.rs
├── data/                       # (Optional) For opening books, test positions, etc.
│   └── openings.bin

└── Cargo.lock

Explanation of Modules:

main.rs: Keeps the main application logic clean, primarily focusing on the UCI communication loop and orchestrating calls to the Engine.

board.rs: Encapsulates everything related to the board's state and fundamental operations that modify it.

moves.rs: Dedicated to the logic of generating and validating chess moves. This keeps the Board struct focused purely on state.

engine.rs: Houses the core AI logic: the search algorithm. It will coordinate between board, moves, evaluation, and tt.

evaluation.rs: Contains the static evaluation function and any data it uses (like Piece-Square Tables).

tt.rs: Manages the transposition table, including Zobrist hashing.

constants.rs: A place for all your precomputed data and global constants, preventing clutter in other files.

lib.rs (Optional): If you plan to use your engine's components in other Rust projects or want to structure it as a reusable library.

tests/: Standard Rust location for integration tests.

benches/: Standard Rust location for performance benchmarks.

data/: A general-purpose folder for external data files like opening books.

This modular approach promotes code organization, reusability, and easier debugging.

Phase 1: Core Board & Moves
Project Setup:

Create a new Rust project: cargo new my_chess_engine --bin

Familiarize yourself with the project structure.

Actionable: Create the basic folder and file structure as outlined in "Phase 0."

Board Representation (Bitboards):

Define Board struct with u64 for each piece type (e.g., white_pawns, black_knights, etc.) in src/board.rs.

Define Color and Piece enums in src/board.rs (or src/constants.rs if they're purely constants).

Implement occupied_squares, empty_squares, white_occupied, black_occupied bitboards.

Add fields for turn, castling_rights, en_passant_square, halfmove_clock, fullmove_number.

Implement a Board::default() method to set up the starting position.

Actionable: Create a simple function to print the board state (for debugging) in src/board.rs.

Basic Move Representation:

Define the Move struct with from, to, piece, promotion, and flags (for special moves like castling, en passant, double pawn push) in src/moves.rs.

Basic Board Manipulation (make_move & unmake_move):

Implement Board::make_move(&mut self, mv: &Move) to apply a move to the board, updating all relevant bitboards and state variables in src/board.rs.

Implement Board::unmake_move(&mut self, mv: &Move) to revert the board to its previous state. This is crucial for the search algorithm.

Actionable: Test make_move and unmake_move with simple pawn moves to ensure correctness, possibly in tests/board_tests.rs.

Phase 2: Move Generation & Basic Search
Precomputed Attack Tables (Knights & Kings):

Create const arrays for knight and king attack patterns (e.g., KNIGHT_ATTACKS[square_index]) in src/constants.rs.

Actionable: Write a small test to verify these tables, possibly in tests/movegen_tests.rs.

Pseudo-Legal Move Generation (Pawns, Knights, Kings):

Implement Board::generate_pseudo_legal_moves(&self) -> Vec<Move> in src/moves.rs.

Focus on pawns (pushes, captures, double pushes, en passant), knights, and kings first.

Actionable: Generate moves for a few simple positions and manually verify them, possibly in tests/movegen_tests.rs.

Basic Evaluation Function (Material Only):

Implement Engine::evaluate(&self, board: &Board) -> i32 in src/evaluation.rs.

Start by only summing the material values of pieces on the board.

Minimax Search (No Alpha-Beta):

Implement a basic recursive minimax_search function with a very shallow fixed depth (e.g., depth 2-3) in src/engine.rs.

This will be slow but helps verify the make_move/unmake_move and evaluation.

Phase 3: Optimizations & Legality
Alpha-Beta Pruning:

Integrate alpha-beta pruning into your minimax_search function in src/engine.rs. This is a significant performance improvement.

Legality Checks:

Modify generate_moves (or create a new function) to filter pseudo-legal moves, ensuring the king is not left in check after the move. This involves making the move, checking for check, and unmaking. Place this logic in src/moves.rs.

Actionable: Test with positions where the king is in check or moves would put the king in check, possibly in tests/movegen_tests.rs.

Sliding Piece Move Generation (Rooks, Bishops, Queens):

Implement pseudo-legal move generation for rooks, bishops, and queens in src/moves.rs. Start with simpler methods (iterating along rays) before moving to magic bitboards.

Actionable: Test with various sliding piece positions.

Castling Move Generation:

Implement castling move generation, including checks for king/rook movement, squares attacked, and clear path in src/moves.rs.

Phase 4: Advanced Search & Evaluation
Magic Bitboards (Optional but Recommended):

Implement magic bitboards for highly optimized sliding piece attack generation in src/constants.rs and utilize them in src/moves.rs. This is a more complex step but crucial for a strong engine.

Iterative Deepening:

Implement iterative deepening in Engine::find_best_move in src/engine.rs. This allows the engine to search deeper over time and provides a "best move so far."

Quiescence Search:

Implement quiescence_search to extend the search at the end of the main alpha-beta search, focusing only on tactical moves (captures, checks, promotions) to avoid the horizon effect in src/engine.rs.

Zobrist Hashing:

Generate random 64-bit numbers for Zobrist hashing in src/constants.rs.

Implement hash key generation and incremental updates in make_move and unmake_move in src/board.rs.

Transposition Table:

Implement the TranspositionTable struct and its probe and store methods in src/tt.rs.

Integrate the transposition table into your alpha-beta search in src/engine.rs.

Improved Evaluation Function:

Add Piece-Square Tables (PSTs) for all pieces in src/evaluation.rs (or src/constants.rs if they are static arrays).

Implement evaluation terms for pawn structure (isolated, doubled, passed pawns) in src/evaluation.rs.

Add terms for king safety and rook on open files in src/evaluation.rs.

Consider game phase adjustments in src/evaluation.rs.

Phase 5: Communication & Refinement
UCI Protocol Implementation:

Implement the run_uci_loop to handle standard UCI commands (uci, isready, ucinewgame, position, go, stop, quit) in src/main.rs.

Parse position commands (startpos, FEN, moves).

Parse go commands (depth, movetime).

Output bestmove and info strings.

Time Management:

Implement basic time management for the go command, ensuring the engine doesn't exceed allocated time, likely within src/engine.rs or src/main.rs.

Opening Book (Optional):

Implement a simple opening book to avoid searching common opening lines. This could involve a new module like src/book.rs and data in data/.

Benchmarking & Profiling:

Use criterion or iai to benchmark critical sections (move generation, evaluation, search) in the benches/ directory.

Use profiling tools (e.g., perf) to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

Concurrency (Optional, Advanced):

Explore parallelizing the search using std::thread or rayon for multi-core performance. This will require careful handling of shared state (e.g., Arc<Mutex<TranspositionTable>>), likely impacting src/engine.rs and src/tt.rs.

Continuous Improvement
Testing: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all components in the tests/ directory.

Debugging: Use Rust's debugging tools effectively.

Refinement: Continuously improve your evaluation function and search algorithm based on testing and self-play.

Community: Engage with the chess programming community for ideas and best practices.

This roadmap provides a clear path. Remember to tackle one step at a time and thoroughly test each component before moving on. Good luck!
